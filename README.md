# Sales Performance and Profitability Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance and profitability for a mid-sized, international company using Microsoft Excel.  
The goal is to identify revenue drivers, profit trends, regional performance differences, and product-level profitability to support business decision-making.

The analysis simulates a real-world corporate scenario where management is concerned about growing revenue but inconsistent profitability.

## Business Questions
The analysis focuses on answering the following key business questions:

1. How are revenue and profit trending over time?
2. Which products generate high revenue but low profit?
3. Which regions are underperforming in terms of profit margin?
4. How does sales performance vary across customer segments?
5. How do returned orders impact overall profitability?

- **Products**: Product categories, unit cost, and unit price.
- **Customers**: Customer segments and geographic distribution.
- **Sales Reps**: Sales representatives and their monthly targets.

All datasets were cleaned and transformed in Excel prior to analysis.
